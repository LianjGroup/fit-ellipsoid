# Multiphase RVE evaluation by fitting ellipsoids to 3D grains
Fitting a 3D ellipsoid to an arbitrary 3D shape for RVE evaluation. 
## Running the code
Run the file by first open Git Bash (on Windows, or just terminal on Linux) in a location you want to store the code and run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dinhtrung21/fit-ellipsoid.git # Only for the first run
$ pip install â€“r requirements.txt # Can skip if already install NumPy, Matplotlib and Scipy
$ python3 evaluate.py
```
## Methodology
The report of the method is stored in ```fit-ellipsoid/report/```.
